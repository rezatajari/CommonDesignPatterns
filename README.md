# Common Design Patterns in Action (C# .NET)

Welcome to the **CommonDesignPatterns** repository — a hands-on showcase of the most widely used **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** implemented in **C# (.NET)**. This repo is built not just for demonstration, but for **learning-by-doing** and explaining each pattern clearly with **real-world analogies**.

---

## Purpose

This project is a collection of classic design patterns — each pattern is implemented with clean, real-world use cases, and accompanied by clear explanations in the documentation.

Ideal for:
- Learners mastering C# OOP principles
- Developers strengthening their architecture skills
- Engineers looking for reusable, understandable pattern templates

##  Implemented Patterns

| Pattern Name     | Category     | Status      | Description | Link to Doc |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ✅ Singleton       | Creational   | Completed   | Ensures only one instance of a class exists globally | [Read Singleton Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Creatinal/Singleton.md) |
| ✅ Factory         | Creational   | Completed   | Creates objects without specifying the exact class | [Read Factory Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Creatinal/Factory.md) | 
| ✅ Strategy        | Behavioral   | Completed   | Selects algorithm behavior at runtime | [Read Strategy Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Behavioral/Strategy.md) |
| ✅ Mediator        | Behavioral   | Completed   | Facilitates communication between objects to reduce dependencies | [Read Mediator Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Behavioral/Mediator.md) |
| ✅ Adapter         | Structural   | Completed   | Converts incompatible interfaces so they can work together | [Read Adapter Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Structural/Adapter.md)   |
| ✅ Bridge          | Structural   | Completed   | Decouples abstraction from implementation to allow independent variation | [Read Bridge Documentation](https://github.com/rezatajari/CommonDesignPatterns/blob/master/doc/Structural/Bridge.md)     |

## Documentation Format

Each pattern includes:

- **Real-world analogy** (e.g., MediaPlayer for Adapter)
- **Core interfaces and class structure**
- **Example use case**
- **Conceptual explanation** (no code when clarity matters)
- **Key takeaways** — when and why to use the pattern
