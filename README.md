# Common Design Patterns in Action (C# .NET)

Welcome to the **CommonDesignPatterns** repository — a hands-on showcase of the most widely used **Object-Oriented Design Patterns** implemented in **C# (.NET)**. This repo is built not just for demonstration, but for **learning-by-doing** and explaining each pattern clearly with **real-world analogies**.

---

## Purpose

This project is a collection of classic design patterns — each pattern is implemented with clean, real-world use cases, and accompanied by clear explanations in the documentation.

Ideal for:
- Learners mastering C# OOP principles
- Developers strengthening their architecture skills
- Engineers looking for reusable, understandable pattern templates

##  Implemented Patterns

| Pattern Name     | Category     | Status      | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| ✅ Singleton       | Creational   | Completed   | Ensures only one instance of a class exists globally |
| ✅ Factory         | Creational   | Completed   | Creates objects without specifying the exact class |
| ✅ Strategy        | Behavioral   | Completed   | Selects algorithm behavior at runtime |
| ✅ Mediator        | Behavioral   | Completed | Facilitates communication between objects to reduce dependencies |
| ✅ Adapter         | Structural   | Completed   | Converts incompatible interfaces so they can work together |

## Documentation Format

Each pattern includes:

- **Real-world analogy** (e.g., MediaPlayer for Adapter)
- **Core interfaces and class structure**
- **Example use case**
- **Conceptual explanation** (no code when clarity matters)
- **Key takeaways** — when and why to use the pattern
